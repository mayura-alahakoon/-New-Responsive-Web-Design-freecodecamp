#CSS Important Notes

Typically, HTML is rendered in a top-down manner. Elements at the top of the code are positioned at the top of the page. However, many times you may want to move the elements to different positions. You can do this with the position property.

Set the position property for the back-wall element to absolute. An absolute position takes the element out of that top-down document flow and allows you to adjust it relative to its container.

When an element is manually positioned, you can shift its layout with top, left, right, and bottom. Set the back-wall to have a top value of 0, and a left value of 0.

The z-index property is used to create "layers" for your HTML elements. If you are familiar with image editing tools, you may have worked with layers before. This is a similar concept.

Elements with a higher z-index value will appear to be layered on top of elements with a lower z-index value. This can be combined with the positioning in the previous lesson to create unique effects.
